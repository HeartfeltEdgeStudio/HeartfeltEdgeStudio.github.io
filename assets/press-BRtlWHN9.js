Dive into a surreal, ever-shifting world where reality bends, memories unravel, and every puzzle brings you closer to the truth—or deeper into the unknown. </p><div class="text-nowrap text-secondary text-h5 font-weight-bold pt-4">The Premise</div><p class="text-secondary text-justify text-body-1"> In a university classroom, a radical experiment pushes the limits of neuroscience. Professor Alberto Saggi, a brilliant but haunted researcher, undergoes a dangerous procedure—inducing a deep, drug-induced coma to allow his assistant, Kurt Wagner, to enter his subconscious through an advanced neuro-interactive system. <br><br> What begins as a controlled study quickly turns into a descent through a fragmented mind, where familiar hallways twist into something living, shadows move on their own, and buried traumas take form. Kurt must navigate psychological puzzles and surreal nightmares to uncover the truth about his mentor’s past—before the experiment spirals out of control. </p><div class="text-nowrap text-secondary text-h5 font-weight-bold pt-4">Target Platforms</div><p class="text-secondary text-justify text-body-1"> The game is planned for <span class="font-weight-black text-primary">PC (Steam)</span> at launch, with possible future expansions to other platforms. </p><div class="text-nowrap text-secondary text-h5 font-weight-bold pt-4">Release &amp; Development</div><p class="text-secondary text-justify text-body-1"> Joyful Masks is currently in <span class="font-weight-black text-primary">pre-alpha</span>, with a demo coming soon!
